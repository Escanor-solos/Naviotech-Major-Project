Subject: Justification for Solo Completion of Fake News Detector (Major Project)

I am writing to provide context for the final submission of the [Project Name]. This project was initially planned as a team effort. 
However, following the initial planning stages, my assigned team members became unresponsive to repeated attempts at communication and collaboration via our established channels.

To ensure the project's successful and timely completion in line with the requirements, I made the decision to take full ownership and proceed with the development independently. 
Consequently, I have handled all aspects of the project, from the initial research and architecture to the final implementation and testing.

While undertaking this major project alone was a significant challenge, it was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to gain a comprehensive, end-to-end understanding 
of the entire project lifecycle.
